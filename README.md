# PnR-Final
The final project for my Programming and Robotics class works with various methods of code using Python.
I first learned how my robot could turn, go forward, or backward using a dance method.
Our method was able to work once it was defined, which is what the def next to a term means.
Our robot did this using encode left, right, forward, or backward.
From there, I used separate methods revolving around one method, nav.
Nav loops all of the code and gives all the methods the ability to work.
It's basically a brain for my code.
My robot happened to have a stronger left motor so I needed to make the right motor quicker.
I did this through my setSpeed method.
The final project required my robot to find it's way through a maze using it's sensors.
To start this process we needed a menu in a program called putty, which basically talks to my robot.
This menu was formatted in a method called menu.
For the robot to find it's way through the maze it needed a specific method to do so; therefore, my method is called chooseBetter.
My chooseBetter method chooses an opening in the maze, once it detected something in its way.
This chooseBetter method communicated with a pre-programmed code called flushScan.
FlushScan used my robot's sensors to detect objects.
ChooseBetter was the method that went through the maze and completed the final project.
Another method that I included that Ben Foltz and I worked on was a remote control method called dataBase.
This method was called Test Scan in the menu.  Once it started, my robot would scan the area then give options to choose from to move.
Text highlighted in blue are codes I worked on for this final project in Programming and Robotics that I did not end up using.
Text in grey are also comments and help anyone understand how my code works in more detail.
Overall, my code was able to complete the maze in 2 min and 42 seconds.
This project gave me a great understanding of programming and proved that you need to be an effective problem solver in the real world.
